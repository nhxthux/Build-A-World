# Build-A-World

Build-a-World: Virtual Gacha Simulator

Description: What users may expect when they run the program is that everything is generated based on randomness. Different numbers generated yield different results giving users a variety of items, which later will be the indication to determine if they win or not.

Features:
Automatic random generator for a variety of different items
Inventory system using ArrayList
Inheritance is used for shared behavior across classes

How to Run the Program:
Step 1: Enter your name and enter your maximum capacity (which will determine how many items you can store)
 Step 2: Consecutively enter any number except from 0 to keep the program running without breaking to get items to put into the inventory
Step 3: As the storage being filled, users would have the option to expand the inventory to store more, stamina would be used to expand the inventory
Step 4: The user will win if the overall rarity of the inventory is over 75, otherwise, if the stamina is 0 and the storage is filled without reaching 75, the user will lose
